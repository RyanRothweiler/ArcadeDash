 ☐ reinitialize the game when hotloading. So I can test initialization code easily.
 ☐ 
 ☐ image coloring. multipley color by gl_texture color in platform layer when rendering.



Game Notes:


Engine Notes:
 ☐ when an entity dies, remove it from the list, so we don't always have to loop over it.
 ☐ maybe rename active_entity to entity. Not all active_entities actually move around. 
 ☐ test compile time without opengl stuff
 ☐ ability to try to load fonts but move to a default if can't find the wanted font 
 ☐ allow input from controller and keyboard when both are connected
