 ☐ put in a lose state. maybe restart the game.
 ☐ reinitialize the game when hotloading. So I can test initialization code easily.


Engine Notes:
 ☐ when an entity dies, remove it from the list, so we don't always have to loop over it.
 ☐ maybe rename active_entity to entity. Not all active_entities actually move around. 

Ideas:
 ☐ player gets faster the more enemies killed, goal is to kill all the enemies in the room
 ☐
